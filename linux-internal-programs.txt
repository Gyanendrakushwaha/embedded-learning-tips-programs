Here are few problems on Linux internals, if practiced would help refresh your concepts on Linux and Data structures.

1) Implement a Simple Shell
Create a minimal shell in C that can execute basic Linux commands.
(I/P: "ls -l", O/P: Directory listing)

2) Custom malloc() and free()
Implement your own malloc() and free() functions.

3) Implement tail Command
Create a program to mimic the Linux tail command.
(I/P: File path, O/P: Last 10 lines of the file)

4) Implement Priority Inversion Handling
Simulate Priority Inversion and implement a solution.
(I/P: None, O/P: Fixed Priority Inversion)

5) Custom init Process
Write a custom init process to replace the default init for embedded Linux.
I/P: None, O/P: System booted with custom init

6) Process Forking and Waiting
Create a program that forks child processes and waits for them to complete.
I/P: Number of child processes, O/P: Exit status of children

7) Semaphore-based Producer-Consumer
Implement a producer-consumer problem using semaphores.
I/P: Number of items to produce and consume, O/P: Order of production and consumption

8) User-Space File Reader
Read a file from a user-space program using system calls.
I/P: File name, O/P: File contents

9) Thread Creation and Synchronization
Create multiple threads and synchronize them using mutexes.
I/P: Number of threads, O/P: Thread execution order

10) Priority Inversion Problem
Simulate the priority inversion problem and solve it using priority inheritance.
I/P: Thread priorities, O/P: Execution order

11) Filesystem Traversal using opendir and readdir
Traverse a directory structure and print all filenames.
I/P: Root directory, O/P: List of all files and directories

12) User-Space to Kernel-Space Communication
Implement a simple user-space to kernel-space communication using procfs.
I/P: String message, O/P: Echoed message from kernel-space

13) Zero-Copy Data Transfer
Implement a zero-copy data transfer mechanism between two processes using shared memory.
I/P: Data to transfer, O/P: Data received

14) CPU Information Fetcher
Write a program to fetch and display CPU information from /proc/cpuinfo.

15) File Copy Program
Write a program that copies one file to another using low-level file operations.
I/P: Source and destination file paths, O/P: Copy status

16) Mutex-based File Access
Write a multi-threaded program where each thread attempts to write to a file. Use mutexes to ensure that only one thread writes to the file at any given time.
I/P: Thread count, O/P: File with written data

17) Command-line Argument Parser
Write a C program that takes various command-line options and arguments and prints them.
I/P: Command-line options and arguments, O/P: Parsed data
