Debugging is a challenging task while programming practice. We do face many unknown warnings and errors during our programming journey. Here is a list of few common errors that would occur during the compilation of our code.

Do comment down a challenging situation you faced while debugging an error. One that took 10 hours to debug but was solved with just a ";" .


Syntax Errors:
"expected ';', ',' or ')' before ...": Missing punctuation or incorrect syntax in the code.
"expected expression before ...": Missing an expression where it's expected, like in a statement or condition.
"invalid type argument of '->' (have 'struct ...')": Trying to use '->' on a non-pointer type.
"expected declaration specifiers or '...' before ...": Missing type or specifier before an identifier.

Semantic Errors:
"undefined reference to ...": Function or variable declared but not defined.
"incompatible types for assignment": Assigning values of incompatible types.
"lvalue required as left operand of assignment": Trying to assign a value to a non-variable.
"expression has no effect": Expression doesn't affect the program's behavior.
"too few arguments to function ...": Function call with fewer arguments than needed.
"subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector": Using '[]' on a non-array, non-pointer.

Linking Errors:
"undefined reference to 'main'": Missing `main` function (entry point).
"undefined reference to '...'": Function or variable not defined but referenced.

Type and Conversion Errors:
"incompatible types in assignment": Assigning values of different types.
"void value not ignored as it ought to be": Using a void function's return value.
"request for member '...' in something not a structure or union": Trying to access a member of a non-struct/union.

Memory and Pointer Errors:
"dereferencing pointer to incomplete type": Using a pointer to an incomplete type.
"invalid use of undefined type 'struct ...'": Using a struct/union member without defining the struct/union.
"lvalue required as unary '&' operand": Missing variable for `&` operator.
"invalid type argument of unary '*' (have 'int')": Applying `*` to a non-pointer type.
"void function '...' should not return a value": Void function returning a value.
"free(): invalid next size (fast)": Invalid memory management (e.g., double-free).


File and I/O Errors:
"'...' undeclared (first use in this function)": Using a variable without declaring it.
"too many arguments to function ...": Function call with more arguments than expected.
"'...' has no member named '...'": Using a member that doesn't exist in a struct/union.
"expected ')' before '...' token": Missing closing parenthesis.

Preprocessor Errors:
"'...' was not declared in this scope": Using a macro or variable not defined in the scope.
"unterminated 'if' directive": Unclosed `hashtag#if` or `hashtag#ifdef` directive.
"'hashtag#include' expects '...' or <...>": Incorrect format for include statement.

Miscellaneous Errors:
"division by zero": Attempting to divide by zero.
"control reaches end of non-void function": Function missing return in all paths.
"label '...' used but not defined": Using a label that's not defined.
"case label does not reduce to an integer constant": Switch case label not a constant.
"invalid digit '...' in octal constant": Using invalid digit in octal constant.
"declaration does not declare anything": Empty declaration statement.
