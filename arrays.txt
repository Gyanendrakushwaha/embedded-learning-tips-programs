Some uses of these programs include being useful for finding common data points or timestamps from two different sensors, Monitoring frequency of specific sensor readings or error codes in a sorted log, Retrieving the Kth highest or lowest sensor reading, like temperature or pressure, from a list Compressing data by moving irrelevant or placeholder values while preserving meaningful data, Detecting a recurring error or predominant sensor reading and more...
