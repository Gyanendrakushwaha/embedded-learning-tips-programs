20) Flatten a multi-level linked list.(I/P: 1->2->3 (2 has child 4->5), O/P: 1->2->4->5->3 )

Some practical uses of the above examples include In a sensor array, if data is collected sequentially and needs to be processed in two batches, quickly finding the middle can help split the data efficiently. A system logs data over time but needs to transmit the most recent data first (like a stack). Reversing the list can prepare it for transmission. In a telemetry system, retrieving the nth last data point (e.g., the second last sensor reading) directly. Replicating a task list in a real-time operating system where tasks have priorities and dependencies.


By solving these linked list challenges, you'll get hands-on experience with key aspects of embedded systems. It's like training for a marathon: these exercises build the skills and confidence you need to excel in real-world embedded scenarios.
